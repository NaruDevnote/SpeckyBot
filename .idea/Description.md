SpeckyBot is an open-source Discord Bot with music, games, SFW, utilities and much more!

The Global-Chat is an easy way to connect your chat with other people over different servers!
The setup is really easy. Just include `[GLOBAL]` in any channel that you would like to turn into a Global-Chat!

You want to have certain restrictions on your channels without having a lot of trouble setting it up? Well, SpeckyBot has what you need!
Just add one or more of these channel topic filters in the channel's description and you are good to go!
`[NO-BOTS]`, `[ALTERNATING]`, `[ONE-WORD]`, `[NO-NSFW]` and `[NO-MEDIA]` are the available filters.
